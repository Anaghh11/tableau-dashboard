Mobile Gadget Gurus is a distributor that sells mobile technology devices to retailers across the country. 
Customers place orders and have the items shipped to their stores or distribution centers. 
The COO and middle management of Mobile Gadget Gurus needs a quick and easy way to track the operations of the business on a daily basis. 
I have designed a dashboard for operational managers to use daily to manage their business. 
The dashboard consists of four different navigable pages: one Home page; a page for customer information; one for product information; and the final one for sales rep information.
The data is from 2015 operations.
